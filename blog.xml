<p>Ran out of time on this one a bit. For the lines theme, I delved into the Polar Data Centre categories on human movement.</p>

<p>The 30 days of the challenge are themed by the organiser. Day 1’s theme is <em>points</em>.</p>
<p><a href="../assets/images/blog/30daymapchallenge/day01_AntarcticHistoricalLocations.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="https://davidwyld.uk/assets/images/blog/30daymapchallenge/day01_AntarcticHistoricalLocations.png" title="Simple map of antarctica with historic sites marked." class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>Made as fast as possible to catch up whilst beginning on the fourth day of the challenge using QGIS. I was happy to have plotted anything at all!</p>
<p>Data: <a href="https://data.bas.ac.uk/full-record.php?id=GB/NERC/BAS/PDC/01431">Locations of Antarctic historic sites and monuments from the Polar Data Centre</a> https://doi.org/10.5285/7a6fddc4-291c-4673-af87-0a040616e812</p>
<p>Backed by coastline from: <a href="https://data.bas.ac.uk/full-record.php?id=GB/NERC/BAS/PDC/01391" class="uri">https://data.bas.ac.uk/full-record.php?id=GB/NERC/BAS/PDC/01391</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.5285/065B9ABC-1B5A-4FC6-AA57-9052428AA6CA" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.5285/065B9ABC-1B5A-4FC6-AA57-9052428AA6CA</a></p>

  <title>#30daymapchallenge - a spontaneous odyssey into mapping</title>
  <link>https://davidwyld.uk/posts/2025-10-31-30daymapchallenge.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A few days into November, I became aware of the <a href="https://30daymapchallenge.com/">30 day map challenge</a> which has run every November since 2019 thanks to <a href="https://tjukanov.org/">Topi Tjukanov</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve had a passing interest in digital mapping for a while as well as the (I assume?) standard fondness for maps of all kinds and have learned a little since working at the British Antarctic Survey as a Research Software Engineer. So naturally I dived into an intensive month of making myself learn a new skill every day.</p>
<p>The only way for this to work, especially with a &lt;2 month old baby at home, was to establish some rules for myself.</p>
<section id="rules" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rules">Rules</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Work fast.</li>
<li>Have low standards.</li>
<li>Have fun.</li>
<li>Work mainly on polar data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rules 1-3 are for my survival, I have precious little time like most people and taking more than an hour a day, expecting too much of myself, or not enjoying it would make it unsustainable.</p>
<p>Rule 4 is to help with the others, by narrowing down the potential datasets I could save time, but also learn more about the organisation I’ve worked at for over a year and a half.</p>
<p>What’s the worst that can happen!</p>
