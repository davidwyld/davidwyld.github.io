    "text": "As of 2022 I am a Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute, with a particular interest in developing training and guidance for reproducible methods in Matlab.\n\nbackground\nMy background is in animal vision research using methods from computing and physical sciences. Primarily, my research was in using numerical computational methods to explore the optics of three-dimensional visual anatomy. During my PhD at the University of Bristol I developed FDTD simulations for studying the optics of avian retinal photoreceptors. Following this I worked on ray tracing analyses of 3D ocelli and compound eye volumes of bumblebees and hoverflies with Stockholm and Lund University. More recently I spent 4 years as an RSE at the University of Sheffield’s RSE team.\nHowever, I’ve had an eclectic career including (but not limited to): startling hermit crabs in behavioural experiments; training chickens to study their colour vision; diving for mantis shrimp to study their secret polarized signals; and doing R&D on TeraHertz electronics for space science."

So naturally I dived into an intensive month of making myself learn a new skill every day.\nThe only way for this to work, especially with a &lt;2 month old baby at home, was to establish some rules for myself."
