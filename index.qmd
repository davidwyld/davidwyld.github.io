Hi! I am David Wyld (formerly Wilby), a Senior Research Software Engineer at the British Antarctic Survey. 
My professional interests are in facilitating the best possible practice in research computing, from good training to advocating reproducible scientific software methods and building high quality research software projects.
I'm also interested in bicycles, woodworking, adventure racing to name a few things.
