Hi! I am David Wyld (formerly Wilby), a Senior Research Software Engineer at the British Antarctic Survey. 
My interest is in facilitating the best possible practice in research computing, from good training to advocating reproducible scientific software methods.

As of 2022 I am a [Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows/david-wilby), with a particular interest in developing training and guidance for reproducible methods in Matlab.

### background
My background is in animal vision research using methods from computing and physical sciences. Primarily, my 
research was in using numerical computational methods to explore the optics of three-dimensional visual 
anatomy. During my PhD  at the University of Bristol I developed FDTD simulations for studying the optics 
of avian retinal photoreceptors. Following this I worked on ray tracing analyses of 3D ocelli and compound eye 
volumes of bumblebees and hoverflies with Stockholm and Lund University. More recently I spent 4 years as an RSE at the University of Sheffield's RSE team.

However, I've had an eclectic career including (but not limited to): startling hermit crabs in behavioural 
experiments; training chickens to study their colour vision; diving for mantis shrimp to study their secret 
polarized signals; and doing R&D on TeraHertz electronics for space science.
